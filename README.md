This website is linked with multiple websites. I decided to do this way rather than navigate within one page, becasue I think it is easier to 
organize for future use since i can just simply copy a new link and change the subjects or remove the whole section by removing the link.

this website is a incompte product because I am not so sure what i can put up yet. I have no experiences and so social medias except 
WeChat( not popular and not well recognized). This is my first time to make a website so i mainly spent on time to learn functions in css and html.
The website is hosted by a friend temporily. The following will be the outline for the website.

it contains 4 websites in the Home page(including Home page)- Home, about, Projects, contact.

Home page: there is a navigator bar on the top, home, about, projects and contact are linked with the associated websites. Jiewen on the left should
be a representative logo/icon linked with personal stories/ events/ pics/social medias. right now it's linked with About page. In the middle, it
is some personal information. the piggy picture supposes to be my picture but i dont really feel comfortable to do that. Learn more button id linked
with the contact page right now but it may links to a page about or my interests/hobbies. 

About page: has the same navigator. "The breif statement about myslef" should be an introduction of me, work experience, skills. Right now my work
is not related to CS so i did not add it and i only know java so far. again, i am socially akward, so i decided to levae introduction blank.
plan for 

projects page: has the same navigator. right now it's only linked with hws in github from data strcutures class. plan for it will be actual projects with brief 
discreptions and pictures. 

contact page: so far it only has email and github page. it may contains social media,phone # and other contacts.

About, projects and contact pages follows the design of the home page so far. later, designs will be added to their own style.css. formats are not so organized.
